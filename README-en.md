# PLUG SDK

* PLUG SDK 2.x, 3.x versions are no longer supported.
* A iOS Sample Project contains large files over 100mb. Therefore, the sample project should be downloaded from below link instead of git clone.

The PLUG SDK is a dedicated in-app community library for mobile games, which lets mobile gamers use community features without leaving games while they are playing. It is easy to apply the PLUG SDK to your project.

As a proven SDK, which has been used in many mobile games, this lets you simply and quickly add community features in your game.

## Communication 
If you have any questions regarding working this SDK, please [visit our issue page for unity](https://github.com/naver/cafe-sdk-unity/issues).

## Usages 

### 1. Configure a Project

To use the PLUG SDK, you must set up a development environment in Unity as follows:

1. Go to **Asset** and click **Import package** to import the PLUG SDK package to your Unity game project. 
2. Create the PLUG SDK execute button by dragging **NCSDK.Prefabs** located under the **NCSDK > Sample** folder to your desired scene.

You can create your own execute button of PLUG SDK even though it is provided with the PLUG SDK for your convenience. The sample code is written in the **SampleBehaviour.cs** file. 

> For more information about PLUG SDK for each operating system, visit the GitHub repository.
> - [GitHub repository for Android PLUG SDK](https://github.com/naver/cafe-sdk-android)
> - [GitHub repository for iOS PLUG SDK](https://github.com/naver/cafe-sdk-ios)

### 2. Initialize the PLUG SDK

Initializing the PLUG SDK will vary depending on the supported language.

#### 2.1 Support for Korean only (NAVER Cafe)

Configure the initialization information and comment out the code associated with languages support other than Korean in the script file in order to initialize the PLUG SDK that supports Korean only.

Configure the initialization information below in the **GLinkConfig.cs** file located under the **NCSDK > Scripts** folder.

- NaverLoginClientId: Client ID you received after registering your application in [NAVER Login Developers](https://developers.naver.com/apps/#/register?api=nvlogin)
- NaverLoginClientSecret: Client secret you received after registering your application in [NAVER Login Developers](https://developers.naver.com/apps/#/register?api=nvlogin)
- CafeId: Cafe ID you received after creating your Cafe in [NAVER Cafe](http://section.cafe.naver.com/)

Comment out the code associated with languages support other than Korean in the script file for each operating system, which is located under the **NCSDK > Script** folder.

Comment out the code below in the **GlinkAndroid.cs** file, a script file for Android.

```objective-c
glinkClass.CallStatic ("initGlobal", currentActivity, GLinkConfig.ConsumerKey, GLinkConfig.ConsumerSecureKey, GLinkConfig.CommunityNo, GLinkConfig.LoungeNo);
```

Comment out the code below in the **GlinkiOS.cs** file, a script file for iOS.

```objective-c
_InitGLinkForGlobal(GLinkConfig.ConsumerKey, GLinkConfig.ConsumerSecureKey, GLinkConfig.CommunityNo, GLinkConfig.LoungeNo);
```
#### 2.2 Support for languages other than Korean

Configure the initialization information and uncomment the code associated with languages support other than Korean in the script file in order to initialize the PLUG SDK that supports languages other Korean.

Configure the initialization information below in the **GLinkConfig.cs** file located under the **NCSDK > Scripts** folder.

- NeoIdConsumerKey: Consumer key you received after creating your community
- CommunityId: Community ID you received after creating your community

Uncomment the code associated with languages support other than Korean in the script file for each operating system, which is located under the **NCSDK > Script** folder.

Uncomment the code below in the **GlinkAndroid.cs** file, a script file for Android.

```objective-c
glinkClass.CallStatic ("initGlobal", currentActivity, GLinkConfig.ConsumerKey, GLinkConfig.ConsumerSecureKey, GLinkConfig.CommunityNo, GLinkConfig.LoungeNo);

```

Uncomment the code below in the **GlinkiOS.cs** file, a script file for iOS.

```objective-c
_InitGLinkForGlobal(GLinkConfig.ConsumerKey, GLinkConfig.ConsumerSecureKey, GLinkConfig.CommunityNo, GLinkConfig.LoungeNo);
```

### 3. Start the PLUG SDK

Start the PLUG SDK after initialization is completed.

> **GLink.cs file**  
> The GLink.cs file is a script file that includes the PLUG SDK control method. For more information about methods for Unity PLUG SDK, see [PLUG SDK documentation](https://github.com/naver/cafe-sdk-unity/wiki).

#### 3.1 executeHome() method

The executeHome() method starts PLUG SDK.

```objective-c
GLink.sharedInstance().executeHome();
```

#### 3.2 executeArticlePost() method

The executeArticlePost() method opens a post compose. The forum ID is passed as a parameter.

```objective-c
GLink.sharedInstance().executeArticlePost("Content");
```

### 4. Add Additional Configurations for iOS

To develop game apps for iOS, you must add additional configurations as follows:

#### 4.1 Portrait mode

To develop game apps that require executions in portrait mode, set the NCSDKManager.setOrientationIsLandscape property to "NO" in the **NCSDKUnityManager.mm** file located under the **NCSDK/Plugins/iOS** folder.

```objective-c
- (void)setGLRootViewController {
_mainViewcontroller = UnityGetGLViewController();

[[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] setParentViewController:_mainViewcontroller];
[[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] setNcSDKDelegate:self];
[[NCSDKManager getSharedInstance] setOrientationIsLandscape:NO];
}

```

#### 4.2 .bundle file link

For Unity 5.4.0f3 or later, the .bundle file is not linked by default when building applications for iOS.
To make **NaverAuth.bundle** and **NaverCafeSDK.bundle** linked, you should select **iOS** in **Select for plugin** as shown the image below.

![Configuration to link the NaverAuth.bundle file](http://cafeptthumb3.phinf.naver.net/MjAxNjA5MjFfMTcw/MDAxNDc0NDM1ODY2NjMy.f6PEBXPB6yrmhY0HFRf0ans0jLaE4-kO9RqLmPCd1bcg.4LyBxzBvuulvTM8GZgDJH1-Mc9N9uR7Vzaf6CLaDlokg.PNG.cafesdksupport/12.png?type=w740)
![Configuration to link the NaverCafeSDK.bundle file](http://cafeptthumb2.phinf.naver.net/MjAxNjA5MjFfNjgg/MDAxNDc0NDM1ODY2ODA1.9ks28hm-J0Vws9UxNyw0VuNJXRj6LtlHjcpQQC7FIBEg.58cYn1IJ7HlreiT-9dczAnWNhyJAQemYF_H5HojizBEg.PNG.cafesdksupport/13.png?type=w740)

#### 4.3 Xcode configuration

You must set up a development environment in Xcode as follows:

1. Go to **Build Settings > Other Linker Flags** and add the **-ObjC** option. 
2. Go to **Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries** and add the following libraries. Set **Status** of each library to **Required**.
- MobileCoreServices.framework
- SystemConfiguration.framework
- MediaPlayer.framework
- AVFoundation.framework
- CoreMedia.framework
- AssetsLibrary.framework
